# XFM - Logic file

# comments are the same as Python but support
# JavaScript and C comment styles so `//`
# comments are allowed but not used as much

# comments that have the `>` character straight
# after the hashtag are still syntax highlighted
# like actual code in text editors when they are
# actually just comments still and are ignored
# when compiling like normal comments are

# importing is the same as TypeScript or
# ESModules in JavaScript but without the
# semicolons as said later:

#> import { main } from "@std"

# you would not normally need to import the
# standard library (@std) as it is built in

# variables are the same as Python
#> variablename = "string"

# `f` == defining a function but you can also use
# the word `function` to define a function
#> function printname(name: str) { return print(name) }
#> f printname(name: str) { return print(name) }

# single line functions are allowed but can only
# return things not process them

# params on functions are like Rust a little bit,
# but not fully Rust. you have to say what type
# a param is if the param doesn't exist already

# a multiple line (multi-line) function:
f hw() {

  # all callable things do not need semi-colons
  # to end the line like C and Javascript do:

  print("hello world")

  # you can still use semi-colons for compatibility
  # but it isn't recommended
}

# all programs will need the Main function for actual
# use anywhere. the main function must be exactly
# called `Main`. no missspells allowed so if you
# accidentally call it `main` it won't work

# calling any function `main` will give an error
# saying that this function name is reserved for
# another function

# making a function with the same name twice
# will give an error saying that you have
# 2 functions with the same name

# here I am importing the `hw()` function we
# made earlier for use even though in JavaScript
# we do not need to do that because all functions
# are global by default

f Main(hw) {

  # I can then call this hw function from inside
  # the main function to print `hello world`

  hw()
}

# the actual code of this file without the comments
# is in the seperate file called nocomments.xfml

# the output of this file is called output.js
